# Research-Project
The goal of this project was to predict road surface quality score on scale of 0 to 3 with 0 for unworn roads up to 3 for 
heavily worn-out roads using deep learning regression models.
Real time videos of the road surface around Bay Area, CA and KITTI image dataset was used for training and testing.
Bokeh and Google Maps API was used for visualization of results and the data.
LSTM, CNN-LSTM, SVR, Linear regression were used. 
Tools and Programming Languages: Python (Scikit, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, csv etc.),
Keras with TensorFlow background, OpenCV, Jupyter notebook
